# US_Wildfires

## Data
Data was downloaded from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/188-million-us-wildfires

Data contains geolocalized data for 1.88 milions of wildfires occuring in the United States from 1992 until 2015. All of the incidents have specified time span of the fire, size and number of id's from different wildfire agencies

## Project info
### Analysis
Data was analysed to gain insights about localization, yearly number, mean size etc. of fires to find areas most affected by wildfires and trends in fires properties. Number of visualizations was prepared for different information to show the data in more user-friendly way

### Classification
Second part of the project was to classify fires based on size, location, length and date of discovery into fire causes classes. Number of different classifier were trained and evaluated to find the best one based on accuracy and F1 score. Best classifier was further evaluated based on precission and recalled score. High recall and sufficient precission were achieved. Classifier can be used to check whether cause of fire is suspicious and requires further investigation
